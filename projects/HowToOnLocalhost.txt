Stylesheet rendering with local stylesheets does not work on all web browsers by default.
This is due to security reasons.
The follwing hints helps you to render the CDA documents on your local file system in your favorite browser.

Internet Explorer: 
Currently no action required

Google Chrome: 
start chrome.exe using the following command line argument: --allow-file-access-from-files

Mozilla Firefox: 
firefox.exe -P
Create a new profile (e.g. AllowLocalFiles) and quit profile manager (make sure the new profile is not the default profile!)
firefox.exe -P AllowLocalFiles
about:config
filter for security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy and set it to false
